simcom - A compiler and interpreter for the SIMPLE language
==============================================

Author: Anthony Burzillo

A product of [Peter Fr√∂hlich's](http://gaming.jhu.edu/~phf/) Spring 2013
[Compilers and Interpreters class](http://gaming.jhu.edu/~phf/2013/spring/cs328/) at Johns Hopkins.

******

## Language

In our implementation, the SIMPLE language is a statically typed imperative language with a single basic data type
INTEGER as well as two constructive data types ARRAY and RECORD.

Please see the grammar for the language in doc/SIMPLE_grammar.txt, the example programs in examples/, or the class
website for more information about the SIMPLE language.

## Executables

Consider the bin program in examples/bin.sim which writes the result of two expressions to the screen:

```SIMPLE
PROGRAM bin;
  CONST a = 5;
        b = 7;
  VAR x : INTEGER;
BEGIN
  WRITE a * x;
  x := 10; 
  WRITE (a * x) MOD b
END bin.
```

### sc - the SIMPLE compiler

Print out all the tokens in a program:


```shell
$ ./sc -s examples/bin.sim
PROGRAM@1
identifier<bin>@1
;@1
CONST@2
identifier<a>@2
=@2
integer<5>@2
;@2
identifier<b>@3
=@3
integer<7>@3
;@3
VAR@4
...
END@9
identifier<bin>@9
.@9
```

Create a graphical representation of the symbol table (with [dot] installed):

[dot]: http://www.graphviz.org/

```shell
$ ./sc -t examples/bin.sim | dot -T jpeg > table.jpg
```

Create a graphical representation of the syntax tree (with [dot] installed):

```shell
$ ./sc -a examples/bin.sim | dot -T jpeg > tree.jpg
```

![syntax tree](http://i.imgur.com/IQ3oZkV.jpg)

Run the program in with the interpreter:

```shell
$ ./sc -i examples/bin.sim
0
1
```

### test

This program runs all of the executables in examples/ and reports on any that fail to run.
test can be given any option and that option will be run on each executable.

Run the testing suite:

```shell
$ ./test
$$  Test 'args' was successful.
$$  Test 'arrassi' was successful.
$$  Test 'read_in' was successful.
...
$$  Test 't2' was successful.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
27 tests were run with 27 succesful, 0 failed.
```
